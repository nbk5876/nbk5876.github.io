Your infographic does a good job of clearly illustrating the relationship between Alphabet, Google, and DeepMind. Here are some points for feedback:

<ol>
<li><b>Hierarchy:</b> The infographic correctly places Alphabet at the top, establishing it as the parent company of both Google and DeepMind.</li>

<li><b>Clarity:</b> The information is presented in a way that's easy to understand. Each entity is defined separately, which helps to avoid confusion.</li>

<li><b>Design:</b> The use of boxes and connecting lines is effective in delineating the relationships. The layout is straightforward, which is good for readability.</li>
</ol>

Here are some suggestions for improvement:

<ul>
<li><b>Visual Balance:</b> The box for Alphabet could be made more prominent to emphasize its overarching role. Similarly, Google and DeepMind could be given equal visual weight since they are both subsidiaries.</li>

<li><b>Consistency in Descriptions:</b> Each entity's description varies in length and detail. Aim for similar lengths and levels of detail for each description to maintain consistency.</li>

<li><b>Use of Logos:</b> Including the logos of Alphabet, Google, and DeepMind could enhance visual interest and brand recognition.</li>

</li><b>Additional Elements:</b> Consider adding some visual elements or icons to represent the key points about each entity—for instance, a brain for DeepMind’s AI focus, a cloud for Google’s cloud computing, etc.</li>

<li><b>Color Usage:</b> Utilizing the corporate colors associated with each entity could further improve the visual appeal and brand identification.</li>

<li><b>Interactive Elements:</b> If the infographic will be used digitally, interactive elements such as hover-over texts or clickable links to learn more about each entity could be added.</li>
</ul>

Overall, you've created a clear and informative infographic that effectively communicates the relationship between these entities. With a few design tweaks, it could be even more engaging and visually appealing.

One thing.... the text for Gemini says its Googles most advanced..... but really it was developed by  deepmind...
    </p></div>
<!-- /MESSAGE -->

<!-- MESSAGE -->
    <div class="message msgB"><p>
If you want the infographic to accurately reflect that Gemini was developed by DeepMind, the text associated with Gemini should be updated. You could adjust the phrasing to something like:
<br><br>
"Gemini, developed by DeepMind, is Google's most advanced AI model to date, announced in late 2023."
<br><br>
This wording makes it clear that while Gemini is a product of DeepMind, it is recognized as part of Google's suite of AI technologies, which aligns with DeepMind being a subsidiary of Alphabet, just like Google.

It seems like you've added web links to the ChatGPT and Bard sections of the infographic. This is a great addition as it provides a direct path for viewers to learn more about these specific AI chatbots. Providing resources like this can enhance the educational value of your infographic, giving viewers the tools to explore the applications on their own.
<br><br>
Adding hyperlinks is especially useful if the infographic will be shared digitally. It allows users to interact with the infographic and engage with the content more deeply. If your infographic will be printed, you might consider including a QR code that links to these URLs, as printed material cannot support direct linking.
<br><br>
Overall, this is a thoughtful update that improves the utility of the infographic.
